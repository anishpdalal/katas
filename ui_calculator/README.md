#The UI Calculator#
Wow - we **REALLY** love this kata! This'll be a spin on the string calculator kata, but we'll add the following:  
* We'll be BDD/ATDD'ing it up with Cucumber
* In the end you'll have a web-app that has a calculator interface
* You should have a "go script" to run all tests (and maybe deploy?) your app to Heroku (or something similar)
