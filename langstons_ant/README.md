#The Langston's Ant Kata
A description of Langston's Ant can be found [at this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) 
And if you'd like to watch someone run through a variation of this IRL, [check this out](https://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2008/11/13/kata-langston's-ant-in-ruby.html)

Feel free to add your project to this directory in the repo so that others can share in the learnage!  

You can add your work in a subdirectory with your github username.
For example, when I add my kata, I'll be placing it in the directory:  
```
katas/langstons_ant/your_name_or_something_entertaining/
```

Please be courteous so as not to overwrite or interfere with anyone else's work unless you've discussed this with them ahead of time.

Happy Hacking!
