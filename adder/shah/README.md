##This is my calculator kata. There are many like it but this one is mine.  

While SBT is usually the go-to build tool for Scala, I don't like it. I chose Gradle instead.  
All you SHOULD need to do is download this project and ```gradlew test```  

I left the java directories in place in case I wanted to play with any Java<->Scala.  

One of the joys I've had with this kata is writting tests in Scalatest. I enjoy [the flexibility I have](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/selecting_a_style) here way more than I'd get from something like JUnit.
