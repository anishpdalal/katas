#The String Calulcator Kata!
A description of this kata can be found [here](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

##The BIG GOAL of this Kata - focus on VERY small steps.

Feel free to add your project to this directory in the repo so that others can share in the learnage!  

You can add your work in a subdirectory with your github username.
For example, when I add my kata, I'll be placing it in the directory:  
```
katas/adder/mattjohnson/
```

Please be courteous so as not to overwrite or interfere with anyone else's work unless you've discussed this with them ahead of time.

Happy Hacking!
