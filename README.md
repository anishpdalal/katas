"There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."   
~Bruce Lee

# Focus on form and mastery here
## Remember [The Three Laws of Test-Driven Development](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Three_Laws_of_Test-Driven_Development):
* You can't write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
* You can't write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
* You can't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

Adhere to them in your kata.  

## Look around and learn from others.  
You'll be surprised to learn how others have test driven something. Or of struggles they've had in doing so. Learn from their experiences and openly share yours.  

## Be introspective.  
One of my favorite [leadership principles](http://www.fastcompany.com/3032699/hit-the-ground-running/5-lessons-in-self-improvement-we-can-learn-from-the-marines) is "Know yourself and seek self improvement". Take time at the end of the kata to know yourself better so that you can improve and therefore help others improve.
