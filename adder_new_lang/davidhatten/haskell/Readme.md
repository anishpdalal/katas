### HASKELL
##### Haskell is amazing

So, I don't know everything about Haskell yet. I barely know anything. But I do know that its powerful and amazing.
Haskell is functional, not imperative. Learning Haskell requires throwing away a lot of what you've learned about Java and other OO languages and starting from a blank slate.
I started this exercise with Python, but decided that was cheating. I've glanced at Python before; it was as familiar to me as the outline of a friends house shrouded in mist. Not completely foreign.

##### Haskell describes the world, not how to interact with it

`if` statements can be implemented in the method signature. So the check of "No arguments returns 0, 1 argument returns the argument", can each be handled with a single line each.

```
add [] = 0
add [x] = x
```

In fact, while it took Java ~80 lines, and it took Python ~40 lines, Haskell takes less than 20 lines to complete the equivalent task. 

A lot of this comes from List Comprehensions. The majority of lists you write in Java can be replaced with a List Comprehension. Honestly, I don't want to live without them; they're so expressive and so short and so reminiscent of Discrete Math that I don't know why they're not a default feature of all languages

##### Haskell cuts through Katas like butter

I don't know what it is, but I can see every kata I've ever witnessed implemented in Haskell in fewer lines than I ever thought possible. I don't think I'm going to work on katas in Haskell until after I've solved it in another language. It's too powerful.
