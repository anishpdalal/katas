Our first weeks Kata is the Data Munging Kata. You can find a full description of the kata [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/).  

Feel free to add your project to this directory in the repo so that others can share in the learnage!  

You can add your work in a subdirectory with your github username.
For example, when I add my kata, I'll be placing it in the directory:  
```
katas/data-munging/daveshah/
```

Please be courteous so as not to overwrite or interfere with anyone else's work unless you've discussed this with them ahead of time.

Happy Hacking!
